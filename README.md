Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page. 
I am a flexible developer who enjoys challenges, creativity, and learning new things. 
I have done most of my development work in C, Java, and Python. However, I have also used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP.

I have placed a few development projects here to show some of the work that I have done.
This page will continue to be updated as I get the current projects I am working on in a more complete state.

My [Resume](/docs/JesseTatumResume.pdf) is also available.

# In-class projects
These projects are available upon request, but not linked here so as to not tempt other students.

* Android Java Development  - Wheaton College Android app.
    * I worked using Android Java and XML along with GitHub to redesign the Wheaton College app.
    * I primarily worked on the design and implementation of the game ranking board feature, as well as bug fixes on the who's who engine (searches for students and faculty on campus)
    * Unfortunately this app is no longer fully functioning due to a change in the API hosted by the college (we're unofficial), but this [powerpoint](/docs/WheatonApp.pptx) shows some of the work.

* Multithreaded HTTP proxy - C and Python3
    * HTTP proxy with multithreading and caching. Written with multithreading for concurrency. 

* Tiny bash-like shell - C
    * This project involved process management and multitasking in C in a bash-like shell.

* Data structure implementation - Java
    * Implement and run JUnit testing on the following in Java: Queues, Stacks, Search Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs, Minimum Spanning Trees, Tries, etc.

* Adventure Game - Java
    * A text based adventure game to introduce team programming, creative design, and user input and error handling.

### [Kingdomline](/kingdomline/web/index.html) - Front-end development

Kingdomline is a phone tree service created to provide Christian support and advice for any trouble that someone is facing in life.
I worked primarily as a front end web developer on this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The web design was created using Bootstrap and Twig. 
I also helped the development of the back-end with the Twilio API and PHP.

This project has been discontinued, but the website design is visible following the above link.

## Personal Projects

### [PizzaMe](https://github.com/JTatum95/PizzaMe) - Python3
I decided that I wanted to order pizza from the terminal.
I am still not sure why this is necessary, but it feels right.
In progress, stay tuned for updates!

### [webConversions](https://github.com/JTatum95/webConversions) - Bash scripting

### [changeMAC](https://github.com/JTatum95/changeMAC) - Bash scripting
A script that allows the user to spoof a new MAC address and restore the default (permanent) MAC afterwards.
This can be useful for network testing or privacy.

### [MissionCostaRica](http://missioncostarica.com) - Joomla management
This is a functional and published website that my parents use for mission work. 
I grew up as a missionary in Costa Rica, where my parents are continuing to serve the people of Costa Rica and neighboring countries.
I help maintain and customize this website to better reach anyone who would like to participate in their work.
I took ownership of this project a few weeks ago and I am currently working on updates to the design.
